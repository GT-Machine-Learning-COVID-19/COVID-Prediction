# CS4641 - New COVID Case Prediction
## Team Members: Matt Chen, Chima Okechukwu, Trevor Pope, and Sho Szczepaniuk
Our society is facing an unprecedented pandemic, and we are interested in applying machine learning techniques to predict future COVID cases in counties across the US.

## Summary Figure
One infographic that summarizes our goal apparently (still to come)

## Introduction and Background
We mainly have to do this part

## Methods
Talk about our expected methods of doing so. 
I think we have to do this part too
### Data Sanitization and Preprocessing
We're going to have to get the intersect of our databases that we're using. For time series analysis we can format the data so that we use prior time steps to predict next time steps (sliding window method: https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-supervised-learning/).

### Feature Selection (maybe with Unsupervised Learning)
Tbh we don't have many features as is so I don't know how if we'll need 

### Forecasting with Supervised Learning
Maybe Recurrent Neural Networks (like LSTM)
We can even use simpler Supervised Learning if we use sliding window.

## Results
Still to come!

## Discussion 
Still to come!
